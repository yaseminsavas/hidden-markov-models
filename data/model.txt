Let A be transition matrix which is n by n,
which means you have n states.
a11 indicates transition from state 1 to state 1 and other terms are done in the same way.
Let B be observation probability matrix which is n by k, where n is number of states and k is number of unique observations.
bnk is probability of seeing k in state n. Let Pi be the initial probability distributions for states which is 1 by n.
pn states the probability of being at state n at start.

You can assume that observations are labeled as 1 to k whereas k is the number of unique observations.
Also in the model for observation probabilities (B matrix) you may assume that label names can be matched corresponding matrix elements.
For example, assume that you have observations {1,2,3...,k} in the data file and b23 in your model file corresponds to probability
of seeing observation label 3 in state 2.
Thus, this saves you from ambiguity of thinking whether probability of observations seen in data file corresponds to correct matrix elements in the model.

Format is as follows: You will start reading a text document starting with letter A, and the last element you read will be pn.
